<h2>Top 3 Movies Based on Classic Books I've Read</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Jane Eyre (2011)</h3>
<p>From traumatic childhood events to adulthood adversaries, 
   the plot is so relatably simple but in an era where the 
   rights as a woman are limited and caged, makes it 
   dramatically complex. The cinematic effects
    and the music background played adds to 
    its haunting feeling of hopelessness of 
    the protagonist.It is a top favorite yet I need to
   be mentally and emotional prepared every time I watch the movie.

<h3>Pride and Prejudices (2005)</h3>
<p>This is a feel-good movie.The plot is so simple,
   yet the protagonist, Elizabeth turns things complicated, 
in part of her personal character.
The hate-turns-to-romance relationship between her and Mr. Darcy 
is so fun to watch.</p>

<h3>The Count of Monte Cristo (2002)</h3>
<p>The love for this movie is solely based on the book itself. Yet, to my joy, 
   the movie is also wonderfully created, although some of the characters and plot were 
lost in the process. The book was a thousand pages!</p>
